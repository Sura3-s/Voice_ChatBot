## Troubleshooting :
If the chatbot does not understand your speech, try speaking clearly or reducing background noise.
You might see warnings about tokenizer parallelism; these do not affect functionality.
If audio playback does not work, ensure playsound is installed and configured properly on your system.
Notes
The AI replies are generated based on the facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill model, which is designed for conversational tasks.
The chatbot currently handles each input independently without a long conversation history to keep responses relevant and avoid repetition.
